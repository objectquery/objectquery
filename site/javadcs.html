ObjectQuery is the main inteface for build a "SELECT" query, it allow to add projection, condition, order and having clauses using instances of domain classes.

It is typesafe with compile time check, and produce refactor resistent query becouse are defined using the domani spacific classes.

<b>Example Of Usage</b>

<code>
ObjectQuery&lt;Person&gt; query = new GenericObjectQuery&lt;Person&gt;(Person.class);
Person toSearch = query.target();
query.prj(toSearch.getName());
query.eq(toSearch.getMum().getName(),"elisabeth");
query.gt(toSearch.getAge(),20);
query.order(toSearch.getName());
</code>


the main implementation is GenericObjecQuery but is not garantee that will be the same in future, we suggest to box the creation of ObjectQuery instances in a factory in your code.
